  You can choose to increase your Attack, Defense or heal yourself by spending money in the shop.
  You will have 3 options to fight the dragon, Attack, Defend, and Smite.
    1. Attack: You will attack the dragon, dealing damage to it based on your attack stat. (+Money, +Mana)
    2. Defend: You will defend against the dragon's attack, reducing the damage based on your defense stat. (+Mana)
